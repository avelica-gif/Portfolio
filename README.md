# Portfolio

I updated my portfolio to make it look cleaner and add a customer avatar of myself. I actually added a small bio of myself. 

I am still very new to coding and was having a lot of trouble learning all 3 languages (HTML, CSS & JS).

I know my page is very simple, but believe me, it looks way better than the first time I created this. Slowly but surely. 

There has been many times where I think about giving up on this class but once I do things like fix my homework, it makes me feel better about myself and makes me want to push myself to become better and learn more. Nothing happens overnight, and that is something I need to keep on telling myself when I want to give up. 

I know right now all 3 pages look very plain and simple; but I can't express enough how much worse they used to look. 

I was able to link all my social media's to the icons as well as willitstream.com to the picture in the portfolio.
I am still trying to figure out how to add an icon to make my resume downloadedable. I have added that to the list of issue I need to fix.
Also, I was trying to make my email address clickable, however, as someone who works in email and looking into it, that is how we get spam bots scanning our email addresses getting our information and sending us junk email. So I am going to avoid that for now.

I ended up purchasing a domain for my this assignment. You can find it at https://avelicarubio.com
